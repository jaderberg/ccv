On the cluster, there are certain things which must be done for compilation:
> need -std=gnu89 flag for library compilation
> need to add -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib64 for libjpeg/png etc
> change <libpng/png.h> to <png.h>

For mex compilation ensure
> #define __thread so that __thread is not used
> add -fPIC flag for library compilation
> use mex options with a -std=gnu89
